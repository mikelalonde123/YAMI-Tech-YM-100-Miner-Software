# YAMI-Tech-YM-100-Miner-Software
This is an open-source software development project I made for scanning and managing YAMI Tech YM-100 Cryptocurrency Miners since there is no software to do this that I could find
It allows you to scan for them in a range of IP addresses, Reboot them, Save and load commonly used ranges, initiate a self-check, and view information about them.
This is the first Windows application I have developed so there may be bugs and issues
